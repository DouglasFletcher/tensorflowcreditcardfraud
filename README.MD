# Skewed Credit Card Fraud predition Demo
The purpose of this repository is to create a working demo of different deep learning methods using tensorflow to predict fraud on a skewed credit card dataset. 
The dataset is from kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/dalpozz/creditcardfraud. A sample dataset is stored on this repository (subset of the data).

One purpose of this application is to create a working example using the tensorflow API. Given the importance of deep learning & AI, it is useful to have a 
working reference example related to fraud & analytics. The main goal is to port the demo to AIP as a marketing example - hence it could be used as a way to 
showcase to clients deep learning implemented into the AIP.
